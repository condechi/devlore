"""devlore update — refresh this KB's MACHINERY from the distribution.

Closes the drift gap: installed KBs are snapshots of the machinery at install
time; fixes shipped upstream never reached them except by hand-copying. This
re-materializes the machinery from the dist (pulling the latest) while NEVER
touching what makes the KB *yours*:

  preserved: knowledge/, daily/, quarantine/, scripts/state.json,
             scripts/capture-roots, scripts/code-roots, flush markers, logs,
             your git history
  updated:   every machinery file present in the dist — KB-local scripts,
             hooks, AGENTS.md, .claude/commands + settings.json, uv.lock,
             .gitignore, and (only if this KB has an .obsidian/) the plugin.
             The shared machinery (config, utils, kb_*, capture_config,
             transcripts, activity, kb_commit, staleness, stamp_baseline)
             lives at ~/.devlore/lib/ and is installed once for all KBs
             (see --to-new-layout for the v0.9.24→v0.9.25 migration).

Usage:
    devlore update                       # pull latest dist, update this KB
    devlore update --from <dist-path>    # update from a local dist/clone
    devlore update --to-new-layout       # one-shot v0.9.24→v0.9.25 migration
    python3 update_kb.py --kb <kb-path>  # update ANOTHER KB (bootstrap case:
                                         #   the target predates this command)
