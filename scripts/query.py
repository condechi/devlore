"""
Ask the knowledge base a question — index-guided retrieval, no RAG.

This is the headless entry point for the retrieval breakthrough: the LLM reads
`knowledge/index.md` (the master catalog), picks the handful of articles that
actually answer the question, reads ONLY those in full, and synthesizes a cited
answer. At personal-KB scale (50-500 articles) an LLM reading a structured index
beats cosine similarity — it understands what the question is really asking and
selects pages accordingly. See AGENTS.md §"Query".

With `--file-back` the answer is filed as a proper `knowledge/qa/` article (with
`project:` + `type: qa` frontmatter), an index row is added, and a `query` entry
is appended to `knowledge/log.md`. That is the compounding loop — every answered
question makes the next query smarter.

With `--dev` (PR D code-linking, behind a dev wall) the agent additionally resolves the
answer's load-bearing cited symbols to their CURRENT `file:line` via grep over `crm/` and
`metadata/` — lazily at query time, NEVER stored (line numbers rot; the KB keeps symbols).
The pointers section is framed experimental/unverified and flags consulted articles whose
`status: needs-reverification`. Normal queries stay conceptual and authoritative.

Usage:
    uv run python query.py "How does the correction-method rule work?"
    uv run python query.py "What CN types exist?" --project stripe-ledger
    uv run python query.py "What's our OOB amount policy?" --file-back
    uv run python query.py "Where is the 1¢ OOB amount applied?" --dev

   `[[wikilink]]` citations), `## Sources Consulted` (one bullet per article, why it
   was relevant), and `## Follow-Up Questions` (2-3). The `project:` value MUST match
   the consulted articles' project (use `{project_cell}`).

2. **Add an index row** to `{KNOWLEDGE_DIR / 'index.md'}` (the table has columns
   Article | Project | Summary | Compiled From | Updated):
   `| [[{qa_rel}]] | {project_cell} | <one-line answer summary> | (query) | {timestamp[:10]} |`
   The Project cell MUST equal this article's `project:` value.

## Dev mode: live code pointers (--dev)

After (and only after) synthesizing the conceptual answer, ground it in the CURRENT code:

1. From the articles you actually read, pick the **3-8 most load-bearing cited code
   identifiers** (the function/field/file names central to the answer).
2. Resolve each to its CURRENT location with the Grep tool over `crm/` and `metadata/`
   (OUR code only — never `node_modules`, `dist`, or `.venv`).
3. End your reply with one extra section, after the answer:

   ## Code pointers (resolved live — experimental)
   - `symbol` → `crm/lib/file.js:123` — one line each; mark with ⚠ any symbol you could
     NOT find (a possible rename — say so rather than guessing)

Rules:
- Pointers are resolved lazily AT QUERY TIME and are valid only right now. Do **not**
  write them into any article or file — the KB stores symbols, never line numbers
  (line numbers rot on every edit).{filed_note}
- This section is experimental/unverified: it locates symbols, it does not re-verify the
  articles' claims about them.
- If any article you consulted carries `status: needs-reverification` in its frontmatter,
  add a caution line naming it — its code-level claims may lag the working tree."""
