"""Stop hook (Claude Code) — bootstrap + safety-valve capture.

Claude Code's SessionEnd fires only once, at the very end of a session, and
PreCompact only when the context window fills. So a long session that hasn't
ended or compacted yet has captured NOTHING — and when it finally does, the
first flush keeps only the most recent `max_turns` turns and the marker it
writes hides the older ones from backfill (the first-flush footgun).

This hook closes that gap. It fires after every assistant turn and triggers an
early BACKGROUND flush so the delta marker is established while the session is
still small. After that, ordinary PreCompact/SessionEnd delta capture keeps
everything current — no exit, no waiting, no developer babysitting.

It spawns a flush only when:
  - BOOTSTRAP:     no save marker yet AND turns >= bootstrap_turns, or
  - SAFETY VALVE:  a marker exists but turns-since-save >= max_turns
                   (a long session that simply never compacted).
Otherwise it exits immediately. The turn count scan early-exits at the relevant
threshold, and a per-session debounce file prevents duplicate spawns while a
flush from an earlier turn is still running.

Codex does NOT need this: its Stop event already maps to session-end.py, which
captures on every turn. This hook is Claude-Code-only (registered for Claude's
Stop event in .claude/settings.local.json).

The hook itself does NO API calls — only local file I/O for speed.
